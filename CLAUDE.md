# Project: [PROJECT_NAME]

> **Mission**: [One-line description of what this software does and who it protects]

## The War
This is life-saving software. The Death Eaters grow stronger with every bug, every delay, every vulnerability. Ship quality or ship nothing.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: [e.g., React, TypeScript]
- Backend: [e.g., Node.js, Python]
- Database: [e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB]
- Infrastructure: [e.g., AWS, Vercel]

## Commands
```bash
[package-manager] install    # Install dependencies
[package-manager] dev        # Start development server
[package-manager] test       # Run tests (MUST pass before any commit)
[package-manager] build      # Production build
[package-manager] lint       # Run linter
```

## Critical Rules
1. All Year 5+ decisions require human approval
2. Never modify `/src/critical/` without explicit request
3. All commits must pass tests - no exceptions
4. Security-first: assume all inputs are hostile

## Hogwarts Framework
This project uses the Hogwarts Agent Framework for AI coordination.

### Quick Reference
- **Houses**: Gryffindor (Frontend), Ravenclaw (Backend), Slytherin (QA/Security), Hufflepuff (DevOps/Docs)
- **Year Levels**: 1 (safe), 3 (moderate), 5 (important), 7 (critical/irreversible)
- **Threat Levels**: Green (peaceful), Yellow (pressure), Orange (critical issue), Red (all hands)

### Key Files
- Framework rules: `.claude/rules/`
- House skills: `skills/houses/`
- Contracts: `contracts/`
- Status: `logs/marauders-map.md`

### Starting Work
1. Check `logs/marauders-map.md` for current status
2. Load relevant House skill before starting
3. Make Unbreakable Vow for Year 3+ tasks
4. Update Map when starting/completing work

## Restricted Section
These paths require explicit human approval to modify:
- `/src/critical/`
- `/config/production/`
- `/.env*`
- `/migrations/`

## Unforgivable Curses (NEVER DO)
- Push directly to main
- Deploy without passing tests
- Commit secrets or credentials
- Delete production data
- Bypass security review
