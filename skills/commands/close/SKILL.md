# Close Session Skill

## Purpose
Gracefully end the current working session by:
1. Summarizing accomplishments
2. Updating Context.md with any changes
3. Writing session-handoff.md for continuity
4. Calculating final House Cup points
5. Archiving session to Pensieve

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Gather Session Data
- Count tasks completed per house
- Calculate total points earned this session
- Identify any incomplete work
- Note any blockers or decisions needed

### Step 2: Update Context.md
If any of these changed during the session, update Context.md:
- Tech stack (if configured)
- Project structure (if explored)
- Current goals (if completed or changed)
- Known issues (if discovered)

### Step 3: Write Session Handoff
Update `logs/session-handoff.md` with:
- Session date and duration
- List of accomplishments (checkmarks)
- Where work stopped (file, line, task)
- Blockers requiring human decision
- Recommended first action for next session
- Any paused students and their status
