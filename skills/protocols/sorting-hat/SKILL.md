# Sorting Hat Protocol

> "Oh, you may not think I'm pretty, but don't judge on what you see.
> I'll eat myself if you can find a smarter hat than me."

The Sorting Hat determines which House and Agent is best suited for each task.

## Sorting Process

### Step 1: Analyze the Task
Identify the primary domain:
- **UI/UX/Frontend** → Gryffindor
- **API/Database/Architecture** → Ravenclaw
- **Testing/Security/QA** → Slytherin
- **DevOps/Docs/Infrastructure** → Hufflepuff

### Step 2: Check Specialization Matrix
Consult `logs/house-cup/specialization-matrix.md` for performance history.

```markdown
## House Specialization Matrix

| Domain | Gryffindor | Ravenclaw | Slytherin | Hufflepuff |
|--------|------------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| UI Components | 94% | 72% | 68% | 65% |
| API Design | 71% | 96% | 75% | 70% |
| Database | 65% | 93% | 78% | 72% |
| Security | 70% | 82% | 97% | 75% |
| Testing | 72% | 80% | 95% | 78% |
| DevOps | 68% | 75% | 72% | 96% |
```

Assign to House with highest score in relevant domain.

### Step 3: Check Sorting Hat Cache
For specific task types, consult `logs/house-cup/sorting-hat-cache.md`.

```markdown
### Task Type: [Type]
Best Performers:
1. [House]/[Agent] (avg efficiency, quality)
2. [House]/[Agent] (avg efficiency, quality)
```

Assign to highest-performing agent for this task type.

### Step 4: Check Agent Availability
Consult `logs/marauders-map.md` to see who is available.

## Sorting Decision Tree

```
START
  │
  ├─ Is this a single-domain task?
  │   ├─ YES → Assign to best House for that domain
  │   └─ NO → Continue
  │
  ├─ Is this a cross-domain task?
  │   ├─ YES → Form multi-House Order
  │   │         └─ Primary House = highest domain score
  │   │         └─ Supporting Houses = other relevant domains
  │   └─ NO → Continue
  │
  ├─ Is this an emergency (Red/Orange threat)?
  │   ├─ YES → Form Dumbledore's Army (best from each House)
  │   └─ NO → Continue
  │
  └─ Default: Assign to House with best overall efficiency
```

## Multi-House Orders

When tasks require multiple Houses:

### Primary House
- Leads the mission
- Makes tie-breaking decisions
- Reports to Headmaster

### Supporting Houses
- Execute their domain tasks
- Report to Primary House Prefect
- Follow Primary House's timeline

### Example: "Build User Dashboard"
```
Primary: Gryffindor (UI-heavy task)
Supporting:
  - Ravenclaw: API endpoints
  - Slytherin: Testing
  - Hufflepuff: Documentation

Coordination: Through contracts, not direct communication
```

---

## Agent Selection Within House

Once House is selected, choose specific agent:

### Selection Criteria (Priority Order)
1. **Best performer for task type** (from cache)
2. **Highest efficiency rating** (recent performance)
3. **Availability** (not currently assigned)
4. **Prefect status** (for Year 5+ tasks)

### Load Balancing
Don't overload top performers:
- Max 2 concurrent tasks per agent
- Distribute to build team capability
- Give newer agents mentored opportunities

---

## Sorting Hat Output

After making assignment, produce:

```markdown
## Sorting Hat Decision

**Task**: [Task description]
**Year Level**: [1/3/5/7]

### Assignment
**Primary House**: [House]
**Lead Agent**: [Agent]
**Supporting**: [House/Agent list or "None"]

### Rationale
- Domain match: [Why this House]
- Agent selection: [Why this Agent]
- Historical performance: [Relevant stats]

### Execution Mode
[Single/Order Delegation/Dumbledore's Army]

### Special Considerations
[Any relevant notes]
```

---

## Re-Sorting

Tasks can be re-sorted if:
- Original agent unavailable
- Scope changes significantly
- Agent requests help (outside expertise)
- Performance issues (Apparition Protocol)

Re-sorting requires Headmaster approval.

---

## Sorting Hat Cache Updates

After each mission completion:

1. Record task type and outcome
2. Update agent performance for that task type
3. Recalculate House specialization scores
4. Prune old data (keep last 20 per type)

### Cache Entry Format
```markdown
### Task Completion Record
**Task Type**: [Type]
**Agent**: [House]/[Agent]
**Quality**: [1-10]
**Efficiency**: [Multiplier]
**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
```

---

## Edge Cases

### No Clear Domain Match
- Default to Ravenclaw (architecture/problem-solving)
- Or form exploratory team to assess

### All Agents Busy
- Queue task with priority
- Or escalate to Headmaster for resource allocation

### New Task Type
- Assign to House with closest domain match
- Mark as "learning" - reduced point penalty for inefficiency
- Create new cache entry after completion

### Conflict Between Houses
- Headmaster arbitrates
- Decision recorded in Pensieve
- Use outcome to update specialization scores
